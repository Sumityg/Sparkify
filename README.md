# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data to better understand:
1) How does the price of Seattle Airbnb listing vary throughout the year?When are the prices the highest and where are they lowest?
2) Which neighborhoods have got the best average ratings from the reviewers?What are the most important factors influencing the ratings of an Airbnb listing?
3) What are the most important factors influencing the price of an Airbnb listing?

# File Description
There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.This notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@sumit.yg/analyzing-seattle-s-airbnb-listings-data-49abdc0977c8)
